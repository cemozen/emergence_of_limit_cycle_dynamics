# Hopf Bifurcation: The Emergence of Limit-cycle Dynamics
*Cem Ã–zen*

A *Hopf bifurcation* is a critical point in which a periodic orbit appears or disappears through a local change in the stability of a fixed point in a dynamical system as one of the system parameters is varied. Hopf bifurcations occur in many of the well-known dynamical systems such as the Lotka-Volterra model, the Lorenz model, the Selkov model of glycolysis, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction model, and the Hodgkin-Huxley model for nerve membrane. 

In this treatment, I have numerical simulations for the Brusselator system, a chemical reaction system, to demonstrate the onset of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation producing a stable limit cycle.
