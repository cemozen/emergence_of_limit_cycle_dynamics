# emergence_of_limit_cycle_dynamics
In the theory of dynamical systems, limit cycles are created through Hopf bifurcations. In this repository, I have numerical simulations for the Brusselator system, a chemical reaction system, to demonstrate the progress of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation producing a stable limit cycle.
