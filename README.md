# emergence_of_limit_cycle_dynamics
In dynamical systems theory, limit cycles are created through Hopf bifurcations. In this repository, I have numerical simulations for the Brusselator system, a chemical reaction system, to demonstrate a supercritical Hopf bifurcation and the emergence of a stable limit cycle.
